    <h2><strong>Story of Balbir Singh Dosanjh life : </strong></h2>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong><i>I was born in a village. After a few years, my parents 
    brought me to a small town. There I saw her for the first time. 
    I liked her, respected her, loved her and worshipped her. 
    She became my Goddess, my first love and my darling. 
    Our love blossomed in London. We married in Helsinki and 
    honeymooned in Melbourne. After a period of 11 long years, my fairy 
    of the heavens returned to me as fresh and charming as ever. 
    This time she took me to Kuala Lumpur, and we were again on top of 
    the world. She vanished again, but with a promise that she would 
    return. I am waiting for her – my hockey fairy. She must come.</i></strong></p></li>

<li><p>Balbir Singh Dosanjh, one of India’s greatest hockey players,
    passed away, aged 95, in Chandigarh earlier this day (May 25). 
    Better known as Senior – not just because he was the first of five
    Balbirs to play for India but also perhaps because he had the 
    largest archive of memories – he is best remembered as the man 
    who scored the most goals in an Olympic hockey final. His record in 
    the gold medal clash remains untouched, 68 years since it happened. 
    The goals were not an aberration. Balbir Sr. was.</p></li>

<li><p>For the uninitiated, the statistics are all you need. Balbir Sr, 
    participated at three Olympic Games in his career. He was part of 
    the team that won independent India’s first ever gold medal at the 
    Games in 1948. He scored five of India’s six goals in the final of 
    the 1952 Games, setting a record that is yet to be surpassed, and 
    he captained the team to a sixth gold in 1956 (3rd as Independent 
    India) in Melbourne – playing with a broken right hand for most of 
    the tournament. </p></li>

<li><p>Balbir Sr. was also the coach of the Indian team when they won 
    their lone World Cup in 1975. He was manager for eight tournaments 
    in all, and India won a medal each time. (gold at the 1966 Asian 
    Games, bronze at the 1971 World Cup, bronze at 1982 Champions Trophy 
    and silver at the 1982 Asian Games).</p></li>
    
<li> <p>Talk to any old time hockey player and they will rue the day the 
    rules changed, they will talk about ‘how tough it is on these boys 
    because of the change in the game’. Not Balbir Sr.. He was always 
    clear. He was patient, understanding, and tolerant, but clear about 
    the present of the game. It had moved on. Why shouldn’t everyone else? 
    Moving on, adapting, and making his way in the world had been a big 
    part of Balbir Singh Sr.’s life. Hockey, a small part of that journey 
    would affect him the most.</p></li>
